function [pathloss] = path_loss(distance, centerFrequency)
    % Function:
    %   - calculate the large-scale signal attenuation based on IEEE TGn channel model D
    %
    % Input:
    %   - distance (d): distance between the transmitter and the receiver
    %
    % Output:
    %   - pathloss (\Lambda): large-scale channel strength reduction
    %
    % Comment:
    %   - consists of the free space loss (exponent = 2) up to 10 m and typical urban loss (exponent = 3.5) onwards
